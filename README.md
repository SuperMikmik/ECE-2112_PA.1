<h1>ALPHABET SOUP PROBLEM</h1> <br>
Create a function that takes a string and returns a string with its letters in alphabetical order. <br>
For this problem, the .sort function comes to mind. After utilizing the .sort function, the immediate obstacle is that the .sort of the functionâ€™s output is a list. So, it must be combined into one word to achieve the goal of the instructions. That is where the .join function comes to the rescue.  <br>
